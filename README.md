# SWAT-Test

**Details:**

Tobii Dynavox would like a system that keeps track of their entire eye tracking product catalogue. The system should be capable of displaying the product name, the product type and the price of the product.

There are two types of products - peripheral and integrated.

The price of the integrated products may be anywhere within the range of 1000 to 2600 dollars.

The price of the peripheral products may be any positive, non-zero value.

The system shall be capable of allowing new products to be added to the catalogue, as well as removing and editing products. The system should also filter out duplicate products (no two products of the same name).

The UX of the system has been specified by the UX designer. The system should follow this specification, provided below.

**Comments:**

We want to see how you code, so focus more on the structure of the underlying code rather than concerning yourself with making the UI exactly according the specification.

**Technologies:**

C#
